# BCI-Design
The software package for automating the EEG processing in brain-computer interfaces (BCI).

It implements a set of widely used in BCIs methods and algorithms for EEG processing and allows the researcher to choose the methods and algorithms that provide the best recognition of the user's commands in a specific brain-computer interface. 

All components of the software package are written in visual programming language NI LabVIEW. 

The "BCI Design" software package requires the operating system "Windows 7 / 8.1 / 10", visual programming environment "NI LabVIEW 2016" with extension packages "NI Vision", "Advanced Signal Processing Toolkit", and "Machine Learning Toolkit".

The graphical user interface of "BCI Design" components is in Russian.
